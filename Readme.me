Project we had to do in our Computer Networks (EECE 350) course in the American University of Beirut (AUB). The code is in python and is basic network programming.
I did this project with my classmate Yasmin Wehbeh, and the code works well enough.
We used Elementary OS as our testing system because it was the most easy to use Linux OS.
